# honorverse_module
A custom Module for Starships Horizons Bridge Simulator

# WARNING: MAJOR WIP

IF you have Starship Horizons:
  You can download the custom module folder ('H') and add it to your Modules directory. By doing so you can now use the SH UI to modify files instead of a text editor.
  
IF you DONT have Starship Horizons:
  You'll need a text editior capable of working in xml files. (See Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, etc). 
  
  
# Shortterm To Do:
(Note: Year in game is PD 1924, data should reflect that)
1. Add Pedia entries (see https://honorverse.fandom.com/wiki/ for information). Change tense from past to present (i.e. was = is, used to = uses)
2. Add custom government types for use in factions
3. Add factions & faction relationships
4. Add Names for the following: NPC's, Systems, Vessels
5. Add Ordanace for all factions as would be in use in 1924

# Longterm To Do:
1. Add Vessel model files
2. Add dialog
3. Add encounters & events
4. Add companies
5. Add Maps
6. Add Commodities as relevant (i.e. Kodiak Max pelts would be a great relevant black-market item)
7. Add Missions/Campaigns
