			<description>The Solarian League was the largest, wealthiest, and most powerful star nation in existence in the 20th Century PD, consisting of Earth itself and thousands of colonies surrounding the Sol System. 
The Solarian League acted as a confederation. The League Assembly was the legislative branch of its government, while the Executive Council, as the name implied, was the executive branch. All members were given equal representation, and every member had veto power.</description>
